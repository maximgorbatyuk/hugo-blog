## 1. Requirement gathering and analysis

All relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expectation. Who will be the end user, that is the purpose of the product.

## 2. Design

The requirement gathered in the SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document. The document is used as an input and software architecture is derived.

## 3. Implementation / coding

The step starts once the developer gets the Design document. The design is translated into source code. All the components of the software are implemented.

## 4. Testing.

The step starts once the coding is complete and the modules are released for testing. The software is tested thoroughly (тщательно) and any defects found are assigned to developers to get them fixed.

## 5. Deployment.

Once the product tested, it is deployed in the production environment or first UAT (User Acceptance testing) is done depending on the customer expectation.

## 6. Maintenance.

After the product deployed, maintenance starts. Any issue comes up and needs to be fixed are taken care by the developers.
