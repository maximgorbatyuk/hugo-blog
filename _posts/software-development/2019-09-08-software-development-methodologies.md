# Agile
Agile. A methodology that focuses on adoptive development. Main principles are:

- Individuals and interactions are over processes and tools.
- Working software over documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiations
- Responding to changes over following a plan.

# Scrum
Scrum is one of the Agile implementation and actually is the most popular. It brings project roles and a little bit more recommendations than Agile does. Also it has different artefacts and events to make processes transparent and more collaborative with a customer.

# Kanban
Kanban is a method that appeared in Japan. I bases on limits and continuous workflow and lean development too. Each task is a card, and there should not be Work in progress cards more than accepted limit. There are different meetings and artefacts like in Scrum but no sprint and therefore sprint goals too.

# Lean development
Lean development - a set of principles that can be applied to software development to decrease programming effort, budgeting and defect rates. Principles:

- Waste elimination (устранение)
- Amplifying (усиливающийся) Learning
- Late Decision Making
- Fast Delivery
- Team Empowerment (расширение прав и возможностей)
- Built-in Integrity
- View Applications as a Whole

# RUP
RUP. Rational Unified Process divides the development into four phases:

- Inception - what resources will be needed and what a purpose.
- Elaboration - architecture and required resources are further evaluated. Developers consider tools and costs
- Construction - the project is developed and completed. The software is designed, written and tested.
- Transition - the software is released to the public. Feedback from users.

# RAD 
RAD - Rapid Application Development - is designed to be a flexible to changes and to accept new inputs, like features and functions, at every step of the development process. It is very similar to Agile, but there are differences. Quality is more important than deadline (otherwise in Agile). RAD is not applicable to large teams, and mainly is used to implement a little project as far as it possible but without quality losses.

# Waterfall
Waterfall is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, where each phase depends on the previous one. Requirement-Design-Implementation-Verification/Testing - Maintenance.

# Spiral model
Spiral model

# Extreme Programming
Extreme Programming is the most specific of the agile regarding appropriative engineering practices for software development. Is more applicable when:

- Dynamically changing software requirements
- Risks caused by fixed time projects using new technologies
- Small, co-located team
- The technology you are using allows for automated unit and functional tests.

Values are: communication, simplicity, feedback, courage and respect. 

Test-first, CI, Sit together, 10-minute-build, pair programming.
